                <h2>Your guide</h2>
                <p>Years ago, I left the vibrant warmth of Ghana, my hometown, and arrived in Cardiff a city I had never set foot in but would soon call home. From the moment I walked its cobbled streets, surrounded by the rhythm of a bustling yet welcoming community, I felt an unexpected connection. Cardiff, with its blend of modernity and history, its serene parks, and its spirited people, embraced me in ways I couldn’t have imagined. It wasn’t just a place to live; it became a part of me; a city that nurtured my growth, celebrated my differences, and made me fall in love with its unique charm.</p>
